    <h1 class="text-center mb-4">Terms of Service (TOS) for Buy Whatever You Want Store</h1>
    <p class="text-center">Effective Date: March 27, 2025</p>

    <!-- Introduction Section -->
    <section>
        <h2 class="tos-section-title">1. Introduction</h2>
        <p class="tos-section-content">1.1. Welcome to Buy Whatever You Want Store (hereafter referred to as "The Store", "We", "Our", or "Us"). These Terms of Service ("TOS") govern your use of our website (www.yourstorename.com), mobile applications, and all other services, products, and content related to our offerings (collectively, the "Services").</p>
        <p class="tos-section-content">1.2. By accessing or using our Services, you (hereinafter referred to as the "User", "You", or "Customer") agree to be bound by these Terms, including any future amendments, updates, or modifications. Should you disagree with any part of these terms, we kindly request that you leave the site immediately and reconsider whether you truly need the items you seek to purchase.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Definitions Section -->
    <section>
        <h2 class="tos-section-title">2. Definitions</h2>
        <p class="tos-section-content"><strong>2.1.</strong> "Product" refers to any physical or digital goods available for purchase on The Store.</p>
        <p class="tos-section-content"><strong>2.2.</strong> "Transaction" refers to any attempt, completed or not, to purchase a Product or access any of the Services.</p>
        <p class="tos-section-content"><strong>2.3.</strong> "User Content" refers to any content you may submit, upload, or otherwise contribute to the site, including but not limited to product reviews, comments, or feedback.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- User Eligibility Section -->
    <section>
        <h2 class="tos-section-title">3. User Eligibility</h2>
        <p class="tos-section-content">3.1. You must be at least 18 years of age, or the age of majority in your jurisdiction, to use our Services. If you are under the age of majority, please consult a guardian, as we cannot and will not offer any legal or parental advice.</p>
        <p class="tos-section-content">3.2. You must also ensure that you are capable of entering into a legally binding contract under the laws applicable to you. If you are uncertain, consider consulting a lawyer, a trusted adult, or a very wise owl.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Account Registration Section -->
    <section>
        <h2 class="tos-section-title">4. Account Registration</h2>
        <p class="tos-section-content">4.1. In order to access certain features of the Services, you may be required to register for an account. You may register by providing your name, email address, and other required information. If you choose to provide this information, you agree that it will be truthful and accurate, and that you will promptly update your account information when any changes occur.</p>
        <p class="tos-section-content">4.2. Please ensure that the password you select is complex enough to withstand both the most casual and serious of cyberattacks. A combination of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters is highly recommended. Additionally, remember to avoid using easy-to-guess words like "password123" or "iloveyou" (unless you are, in fact, a character in a cheesy romantic novel, in which case, please disregard this advice).</p>
        <p class="tos-section-content">4.3. You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials, and you agree to notify us immediately if you suspect any unauthorized access or usage of your account. Alternatively, you could take immediate action and change your password yourself. The choice is yours.</p>
    </section>
